## Fresh Water Tropical Fish Aquaria for the Novice
Congratulations! - You have decided to start an aquarium to keep fresh water tropical fish.

This is a very exciting and rewarding hobby and some people stay with it a long time.

Others get discouraged and quit after a short while. 

The following information and accompanying program are designed to start you off on solid footing.
With early success, you will quickly learn how much fun it is to keep live fish in your home and you 
will soon also be learning about the extensive list of species of fish that can be kept in home aquaria.

We have developed a very simple algorithm to quickly generate a suggested roster of compatible, 
colorful and easy to care for tropical fish that are relatively inexpensive and readily available.

## Size of Aquarium
The very first parameter you need to consider is "What is the best size for my first aquarium?
One of the most common failures in the aquarium hobby is over-crowding the tank with too many fish.  You will want to put more fish in your tank than is healthy.

Get an idea of how large or small of a fish tank you can handle, in terms of:
SPACE: where you will place it in your home or office?  How much weight that place can support (water is heavy:  about 8 pounds per gallon!).
EXPENSE: this can add up quickly (filters, air pump, light / lid, perhaps a stand, gravel, fish, decorations, etc.). CLEANING: larger tanks, may require less frequent breakdown for thorough cleaning. Measure your available space and estimate the 3 dimensions of your ideal aquarium in inches.  This formula will calculate the volume in gallons for those dimensions:

```r
length_inches = 20; width_inches = 10; height_inches = 12
gallons <- (length_inches * width_inches * height_inches)/231
gallons
```

## Filtration and Live Plants
More fish can be kept in a cleaner aquarium and one of the most common failures in the aquarium hobby is 
over-crowding the tank with too many fish.

Choose your type of filtration:
Internal box filter with standard media & floss & activated_charcoal.--
Undergravel filter platform with uplift tubes in the corners.--
Combination of box filter and undergravel filter.--
Power filter placed outside the tank driven by electric motor.--
Combination of power filter and undergravel filter.

Keeping a good number of live aquatic plants will allow your tank to accommodate more fish
due to the natural symbiosis of respiration and photosynthesis and recycling of nitrogen wastes. Plants also need supplemented phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen.

There are several, very beautiful, fresh water aquatic plants that can be part of your tank's decor.  Below are links tha describe some of the more common aquatic plants for your tank:

## Finally:  Let's See Some Fish !!!
Now that you have thought through many of the important parameters of what makes a healthy tank,
how about considering what fish you will actually choose to swim in your new aquaria. The output of our algorithm is a roster of tropical fish that is a subset of the following:

(fancy_guppy)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuPomeLB1HU
(neon_tetra)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YlyKyyUKtk

DO NOT GET ALL THESE FISH AT ONE TIME !!!
It is much better to gradually add species one at a time and allow them to acclimate to the new aquarium environment.
